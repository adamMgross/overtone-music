# overtone-music
Songs made using the Overtone music synthesis library for Clojure

To be able to run a song or create your own music:

1. Install Overtone (https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Installing-overtone)

2. Get Emacs (http://mirror.clarkson.edu/gnu/emacs/)

3. Get Emacs live for Overotne (type this in your terminal:

bash <(curl -fksSL https://raw.github.com/overtone/emacs-live/master/installer/install-emacs-live.sh)
)

4. Open Emacs and make sure you can open a REPL (check out https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider 
                                                           https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Starting-a-REPL
