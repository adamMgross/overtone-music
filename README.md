# overtone-music
Songs made using the Overtone music synthesis library for Clojure

To be able to run a song or create your own music:

1. Install Overtone 
   
         https://github.com/overtone/overtone/wiki/Installing-overtone

2. Get Emacs 

         http://mirror.clarkson.edu/gnu/emacs/

3. Get Emacs live for Overtone (type this in your terminal:
---
         bash <(curl -fksSL https://raw.github.com/overtone/emacs-live/master/installer/install-emacs-live.sh))
---

Then open Emacs and make sure you can run a REPL; for help, check out:
